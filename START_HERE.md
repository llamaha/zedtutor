# 🚀 Quick Start Guide for Zedtutor

## Welcome to Zedtutor!

You've successfully opened the Zedtutor project in Zed. Let's get you started!

## 📚 How to Use Zedtutor

- **Follow Lessons Sequentially**: Start with Lesson 1 and work your way through
- **Complete Exercises**: Each lesson has practice files in the `exercises/` folder
- **Use Command Palette**: We focus on commands rather than shortcuts for cross-platform compatibility
- **Take Notes**: Each lesson has a notes section at the bottom
- **Practice**: Repetition helps commands become muscle memory

## 🎯 First Steps

1. **Open the Command Palette**
   - Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux)
   - This is your gateway to all Zed features!

2. **Navigate to Your First Lesson**
   - Use Command Palette → "file finder: toggle" (or `Cmd+P` / `Ctrl+P`)
   - Type: `01_welcome`
   - Press Enter to open the first lesson

3. **Set Up Your Workspace**
   - Command Palette → "project panel: toggle focus" (to see file tree)
   - Command Palette → "terminal panel: toggle focus" (for exercises that need terminal)
