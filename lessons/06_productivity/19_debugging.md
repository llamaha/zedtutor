# Lesson 19: Debugging (Coming Soon)

Debug your code directly in Zed with integrated debugging support. This feature is under active development.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

When available, you will learn to:
- Set and manage breakpoints
- Step through code execution
- Inspect variables and state
- Use the debug console
- Configure debug sessions

## 📚 Debugging Overview

Zed's debugging features (in development):
- **Breakpoints**: Pause execution at specific lines
- **Step Controls**: Step over, into, out
- **Variable Inspection**: See current values
- **Call Stack**: Navigate execution path
- **Debug Console**: Evaluate expressions

## 🚧 Current Status

Debugging support in Zed is currently being developed. The team is working on:
- DAP (Debug Adapter Protocol) integration
- Language-specific debug adapters
- UI for debugging workflows
- Breakpoint management
- Variable inspection

## 💡 Alternative Debugging

While waiting for integrated debugging:

1. **Use Terminal Debugging:**
   - Run debuggers in terminal
   - `node --inspect`
   - `python -m pdb`
   - Language-specific tools

2. **Console Debugging:**
   - Add log statements
   - Use conditional logs
   - Temporary debug code
   - Clean up after

3. **External Debuggers:**
   - Use browser DevTools
   - Language IDEs for debugging
   - Return to Zed for editing
   - Hybrid workflow

## 📝 Future Features

Expected debugging capabilities:
- Visual breakpoint indicators
- Inline variable values
- Conditional breakpoints
- Logpoints
- Exception breakpoints
- Remote debugging
- Multi-threaded debugging

## ✅ Stay Updated

Check for updates on:
- Zed's official documentation
- GitHub releases
- Community forums
- Extension marketplace
