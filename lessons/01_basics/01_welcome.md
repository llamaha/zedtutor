# Lesson 1: Welcome to Zed & Command Palette Basics

Welcome to Zedtutor! In this first lesson, you'll learn the most important feature of Zed: the Command Palette.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:
- Understand what the Command Palette is
- Know how to open and use the Command Palette
- Execute your first commands
- Understand command naming conventions

## üìö The Command Palette

The Command Palette is the gateway to almost everything in Zed. Think of it as a searchable menu of all available actions. Instead of memorizing keyboard shortcuts, you can search for and execute any command.

### Why Use the Command Palette?
- ‚úÖ Works the same on all platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- ‚úÖ No need to memorize complex key combinations
- ‚úÖ Discover features as you type
- ‚úÖ Faster than navigating menus

## üèÉ Exercise 1: Opening the Command Palette

**Your first task:**

1. Open the Command Palette using one of these methods:
   - Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Linux/Windows)
   - Use the menu: `Go > Command Palette`

2. You should see a search box appear at the top of the window

3. Type "welcome" - notice how commands filter as you type

4. Press `Escape` to close the Command Palette (the Welcome screen will remain open)

**Try it now!** Open and close the Command Palette a few times to get comfortable.

## üèÉ Exercise 2: Understanding Command Names

Commands in Zed follow a naming pattern: `namespace: action`

Examples:
- `editor: undo` - Undo in the editor
- `workspace: new` - Create a new file
- `project: find in project` - Search across all files

**Your task:**
1. Open the Command Palette
2. Type "new file" and see what appears
3. Select `workspace: new` and press Enter
4. A new untitled file will open!

## üèÉ Exercise 3: Setting Up Your Learning Workspace

Let's set up an ideal workspace for learning:

1. **Split your editor** (if you have two files open):
   - Open Command Palette
   - Type "split"
   - Select `pane: split right` (or `pane: split down`)
   - Now you have two panes!

2. **Optional: Use Markdown Preview**
   - Click on this lesson file
   - Open Command Palette
   - Type "preview"
   - Select `editor: preview`
   - The lesson becomes more readable!

3. **Navigate between panes:**
   - Open Command Palette
   - Type "focus"
   - Try `pane: focus next` or `pane: focus previous`

üí° **Tip:** This split view lets you read lessons while working on exercises!

## üèÉ Exercise 4: Exploring Available Commands

Let's explore what's available:

1. Open the Command Palette
2. Try typing these terms and see what commands appear:
   - "save"
   - "close"
   - "search"
   - "settings"
   - "theme"

Don't execute these yet - just observe the available options.

## üèÉ Exercise 5: Your First Real Commands

Now let's execute some commands:

1. **Save your file:**
   - Open Command Palette
   - Type "save"
   - Select `workspace: save`
   - Save it as `my-first-file.txt` in the `exercises` folder

2. **Open a file:**
   - Open Command Palette
   - Type "open"
   - Select `workspace: open file`
   - Navigate to `exercises/01_command_palette_practice.md`

## üí° Pro Tips

- The Command Palette shows recently used commands at the top
- You can type partial words: "w n" will match "workspace: new"
- Press `Escape` to cancel without executing
- Commands show keyboard shortcuts (when available) on the right

## ‚úÖ Lesson Summary

You've learned:
- How to open the Command Palette
- How Zed commands are organized
- How to search for and execute commands
- The basics of file operations through commands

## üéØ Practice Challenge

Before moving to the next lesson, try to:
1. Create a new file using the Command Palette
2. Save it with a specific name
3. Close the file
4. Open it again

All using only the Command Palette!
