# Lesson 10: Using the Outline Panel

Master the Outline Panel to visualize and navigate your code structure at a glance. This powerful tool provides a bird's-eye view of your files.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:
- Toggle and use the Outline Panel effectively
- Navigate code structure visually
- Filter and search within outlines
- Understand outline symbols and hierarchy
- Use outline for code comprehension

## 📚 Outline Panel Overview

The Outline Panel shows:
- **Classes and Interfaces**: Type definitions
- **Functions and Methods**: All callable code
- **Variables and Constants**: Top-level definitions
- **Properties**: Object and class members
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Nested relationships

## 🏃 Exercise 1: Outline Panel Basics

Open `exercises/10_outline_basics.js` and practice:

1. **Toggle the Outline Panel:**
   - Command Palette → "outline panel: toggle focus"
   - Panel appears showing file structure
   - Notice the hierarchical view

2. **Navigate using outline:**
   - Click any item to jump to it
   - See current location highlighted
   - Collapsible sections for organization

3. **Outline symbols:**
   - Different icons for different types
   - Classes, functions, variables, etc.
   - Color coding by type

4. **Auto-follow mode:**
   - Outline follows cursor position
   - Current symbol highlighted
   - Great for orientation in large files

## 🏃 Exercise 2: Outline Search and Filter

Practice with `exercises/10_complex_structure.ts`:

1. **Search within outline:**
   - Focus on outline panel
   - Start typing to filter
   - Fuzzy matching works here too

2. **Filter by symbol type:**
   - Some languages support type filtering
   - Show only functions, only classes, etc.
   - Simplify complex outlines

3. **Keyboard navigation:**
   - Use arrow keys in outline
   - Enter to jump to symbol
   - Tab to expand/collapse

4. **Sort options:**
   - By position (default)
   - Alphabetically (if supported)
   - By symbol type

## 🏃 Exercise 3: Working with Complex Files

Continue practicing with any large JavaScript file:

1. **Collapse/expand all:**
   - Collapse all for overview
   - Expand specific sections
   - Manage visual complexity

2. **Navigate nested structures:**
   - Classes with many methods
   - Nested objects
   - Module patterns

3. **Jump between related symbols:**
   - Constructor to methods
   - Interface to implementation
   - Parent to child classes

4. **Use outline as documentation:**
   - Quick API overview
   - Understand file organization
   - Find specific functionality

## 🏃 Exercise 4: Multi-File Workflow

Practice across multiple files:

1. **Outline follows active editor:**
   - Open multiple files
   - Switch between tabs
   - Outline updates automatically

2. **Compare file structures:**
   - Open files in splits
   - See different outlines
   - Understand relationships

3. **Refactoring workflow:**
   - Use outline to plan changes
   - See all affected symbols
   - Navigate systematically

4. **Code review with outline:**
   - Quickly understand new code
   - Jump to specific sections
   - Verify structure

## 🏃 Exercise 5: Language-Specific Features

Explore outline features in files of different languages:

1. **JavaScript/TypeScript:**
   - Classes, functions, methods
   - Async indicators
   - Export status

2. **Python:**
   - Classes and methods
   - Decorators shown
   - Nested functions

3. **Markdown:**
   - Heading hierarchy
   - Quick document navigation
   - Section jumping

4. **CSS/SCSS:**
   - Selectors and rules
   - Media queries
   - Nested structures

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Sticky Outline**: Keep outline open while coding for constant reference
- **Breadcrumbs Alternative**: Outline shows more context than breadcrumbs
- **Quick Orientation**: Open outline first in unfamiliar files
- **Combine with Symbol Search**: Use both for maximum efficiency
- **Language Server**: Better outline with language server active

## ✅ Lesson Summary

You've mastered:
- Outline Panel navigation
- Searching and filtering symbols
- Complex file navigation
- Multi-file workflows
- Language-specific features

## 🎯 Practice Challenge

Complete the outline navigation challenge:
1. Open any complex JavaScript or TypeScript file
2. Using ONLY the outline panel, find:
   - All async functions
   - The main class constructor  
   - All exported symbols
   - Error handling methods
   - The deepest nested function
3. Practice navigating between related symbols
4. Time limit: 5 minutes

Can you beat the clock?
