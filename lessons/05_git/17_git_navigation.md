   - Systematic navigation

2. **Hunk actions:**
   - Expand hunk context
   - Stage/unstage hunks
   - Revert hunks
   - Split hunks

3. **Visual feedback:**
   - Current hunk highlight
   - Minimap markers
   - Scrollbar indicators
   - Change overview

4. **Multi-file navigation:**
   - Next/prev file with changes
   - Project-wide review
   - Change summary
   - Quick jumping

## 🏃 Exercise 2: File History

Explore file history features:

1. **View file history:**
   - See all commits
   - Author information
   - Commit messages
   - Time stamps

2. **Navigate commits:**
   - Browse versions
   - Compare changes
   - See evolution
   - Track features

3. **History actions:**
   - View at revision
   - Compare versions
   - Restore old version
   - Cherry-pick changes

4. **Search history:**
   - Find by message
   - Filter by author
   - Date ranges
   - Pattern matching

## 🏃 Exercise 3: Blame Navigation

Use Git blame effectively:

1. **Navigate blame:**
   - Click blame info
   - Jump to commit
   - See full context
   - Related changes

2. **Blame history:**
   - Track through renames
   - Follow moves
   - Deep history
   - Full trail

3. **Blame and fix:**
   - Find bug introduction
   - Identify author
   - See related changes
   - Understand context

4. **Collaborative blame:**
   - Recent changes first
   - Team contributions
   - Code ownership
   - Review patterns

## 🏃 Exercise 4: Branch Navigation

Work with branches in Zed:

1. **Branch indicators:**
   - Current branch
   - Ahead/behind
   - Divergence
   - Sync status

2. **Compare branches:**
   - See differences
   - Changed files
   - Commit lists
   - Merge preview

3. **Switch context:**
   - Change branches
   - Stash changes
   - Quick switches
   - Clean transitions

4. **Merge preparation:**
   - Preview conflicts
   - See impacts
   - Plan merges
   - Test integration

## 🏃 Exercise 5: Advanced Navigation

Power user Git navigation:

   - Compare time periods
   - See progression
   - Historical context

2. **Change tracking:**
   - Follow renames
   - Track moves
   - See refactors
   - Full history

3. **Related changes:**
   - Same commit files
   - Related commits
   - Feature branches
   - Change sets

4. **Navigation workflows:**
   - Code archaeology
   - Bug hunting
   - Feature tracking
   - Review cycles

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Hunk Keys**: Learn navigation shortcuts
- **Blame Cache**: Faster after first load
- **History Depth**: Configure for performance
- **Branch Switch**: Stash or commit first
- **Navigation Stack**: Use back/forward after jumps

## ✅ Lesson Summary

You've mastered:
- Hunk navigation techniques
- File history exploration
- Blame tracking
- Branch comparison
- Advanced Git navigation

## 🎯 Practice Challenge

Complete a Git investigation:
1. Find a bug in the code
