       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

3. **Test connection:**
   - Terminal: `ssh myserver`
   - Verify access
   - Check latency
   - Confirm setup

4. **Key management:**
   - Generate keys
   - Add to agent
   - Server authorized_keys
   - Security best practices

## üèÉ Exercise 2: Connecting to Remote

Open remote projects:

   - Command Palette ‚Üí "remote: connect"
   - Enter SSH host
   - Authentication
   - Connection established

2. **Open remote folder:**
   - Browse remote filesystem
   - Select project directory
   - Load in Zed
   - Full functionality

3. **Connection indicator:**
   - Status bar shows remote
   - Connection quality
   - Latency information
   - Sync status

4. **Multiple connections:**
   - Different servers
   - Switch between
   - Manage sessions
   - Resource usage

## üèÉ Exercise 3: Remote Workflows

   - Retry logic
   - Timeout values

4. **Security hardening:**
   - Key-only auth
   - Jump hosts
   - VPN integration
   - Audit logging

## üèÉ Exercise 5: Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Connection problems:**
   - Check SSH config
   - Verify credentials
   - Network issues
   - Firewall rules

2. **Performance issues:**
   - Latency optimization
   - Compression settings
   - Local caching
   - Reduce file watchers

3. **Sync conflicts:**
   - Manual resolution
   - Backup changes
   - Force sync
   - Recovery options

4. **Resource limits:**
   - Server resources
   - Bandwidth usage
   - Connection limits
   - Optimization strategies

## üí° Pro Tips

- **Local First**: Keep frequently accessed files local
- **Batch Saves**: Group edits to reduce syncs
- **Connection Pool**: Reuse SSH connections
- **Monitoring**: Watch server resources
- **Backups**: Always backup before major changes
