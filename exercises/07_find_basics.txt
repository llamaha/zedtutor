# Find Basics Practice

This file contains various patterns to practice finding text. Use the buffer search
to locate and navigate through matches.

## Practice Text

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The dog was very lazy indeed.
The fox, being quick and clever, easily jumped over the lazy dog.

Email addresses for testing: john.doe@example.com, jane_smith@company.org,
admin@test.io, support@help-desk.com, user123@domain.co.uk

Phone numbers in different formats:
- 555-123-4567
- (555) 987-6543
- 555.876.5432
- +1-555-222-3333
- 5551234567

## Code Samples

```javascript
function processData(data) {
    // TODO: Add validation
    const result = data.filter(item => item.active);
    console.log('Processing:', result.length, 'items');
    return result;
}

function findUser(users, email) {
    // TODO: Handle edge cases
    return users.find(user => user.email === email);
}
```

## Search Challenges

1. Find all occurrences of "lazy" (how many?)
2. Find all email addresses
3. Find all TODO comments
4. Find phone numbers with area code 555
5. Find the word "dog" but not "dogma" or "hotdog"

## Case Sensitivity Practice

These words have different cases:
- example, Example, EXAMPLE, ExAmPlE
- TEST, test, Test, TeSt
- CamelCaseExample, camelCaseExample, CAMELCASEEXAMPLE

Try searching with case sensitivity on and off!

## Whole Word Practice

Finding "the" vs finding words containing "the":
- the (standalone word)
- there (contains "the")
- weather (contains "the")  
- mathematics (contains "the")
- The (capitalized)

Use whole word search to find only standalone "the"!
