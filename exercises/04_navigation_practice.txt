# Navigation Practice

This file contains various text patterns to practice navigation. Follow the
instructions in the lesson and use this as your playground.

## Practice Text - Mixed Content

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This classic pangram contains
every letter of the alphabet. It's perfect for practicing character and word
navigation.

camelCaseWords and snake_case_words and CONSTANT_CASE_WORDS help you understand
how Zed handles different naming conventions when navigating by word.

## Navigation Landmarks

=== Section 1 ===
Navigate to this section using paragraph movements. Notice how blank lines
create natural boundaries for paragraph navigation.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor
incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. This is a longer paragraph that
spans multiple lines, perfect for practicing line-based navigation and seeing
how word wrap affects movement commands.

=== Section 2 ===
URLs and paths: https://example.com/path/to/resource and file:///Users/name/Documents/file.txt
Email addresses: user@example.com, admin@company.co.uk
Numbers and codes: 123-45-6789, #FF5733, v2.1.0, 192.168.1.1

=== Section 3 ===
Special characters and punctuation: @#$%^&*()_+-={}[]|\:";'<>?,./
Mathematical expressions: 2 + 2 = 4, x² + y² = r², ∑(n=1 to ∞)

## Practice Challenges

1. Start at the beginning of this line and navigate to the number: 42
2. Jump from here to the word "Section" in any section header
3. Select this entire sentence using expand selection commands.
4. Navigate through each URL in Section 2 using word movements
5. Move from the first "===" to the last "===" using search

## Cursor Parking Spots

Place your cursor here: [X] and practice returning to it after navigating away.

Remember: Efficient navigation is about choosing the right command for the
distance you need to travel. Character movements for small adjustments, word
movements for medium distances, and jump commands for large distances!
