# Tab Practice File 2

You're getting the hang of it! This is the second practice file.

## Quick Exercise:
Try these tab-related commands in the Command Palette:
- "pane: close other items" - closes all tabs except current
- "pane: close items to the right" - closes tabs to the right
- "pane: close all items" - closes all tabs in pane
- "pane: reopen closed item" - brings back closed tabs!

## Tab Navigation Shortcuts:
While we focus on Command Palette, these shortcuts are worth knowing:
- Next tab: Ctrl+Tab
- Previous tab: Ctrl+Shift+Tab
- Go to tab by number: Alt+1, Alt+2, etc. (Linux/Windows) or Ctrl+1, Ctrl+2 (macOS)

Practice switching to File 1, then File 3, then back here!
